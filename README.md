# Backtrack: An open source project in progress
Creating a playlist? Search for a track in Spotify's catalog to figure out how much danceability, energy, and moodiness to add to your mix. Backtrack is an open source project collaboration between Ashley Kang ([@kangashley](https://github.com/kangashley)) and Jazmin Esqueda ([@jazesq](https://github.com/jazesq)), for "Software Development with Open Source Systems."

## Features
- Remember Windows Media Player? How might we make music listening more visual?
- How might we analyze data about sounds to make visible all the people and work behind making sounds?
- How might we connect sounds with visuals?
> **Danceability** describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 
1.0 is most danceable. **Energy** is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset 
rate, and general entropy. **Valence** is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).

## Check-ins
_December 6_
  - Ashley: Refactored server.js using async/await to see in the console (browser debugger) how Backtrack is interacting with the API. This involved upgrading Node.js from version 6 to 10. `server.js` now returns just the 3 audio features we're interested in: danceability, energy, and valence.
  - Jazmin: Added label to each audio feature panel. Working on translating the audio feature values (0.0-1.0) to animation speed, etc. Refining animation for each audio feature. Friends wish they had something like this while making a playlist for their wedding and activities with youth!
  - #TODO: Connect data from `server.js` to `client.js`. Prepare .zip of source code. Export project from Glitch to GitHub (there's a button for this!). Add contributor guide to documentation.

_December 1_
  - Ashley: Considering a design in which you can search for a track on a left panel, then see a stack of audio feature visualizations on the right. Exploring meaningful visuals (ex: üíÉüèΩüèªüï∫ emoji, .png), animation patterns (ex: waves), and color schemes for each audio feature. Defining how an audio feature value determines the "intensity" of the animation. Refactoring server.js using async/await so we can actually see the API data (in JSON) in the console when looking up and selecting a track!

_November 15_
  - Ashley: Working over at [Backtrack on Glitch](https://backtrack.glitch.me/). Thinking about how the movement of a visual form can be determined by a range based on an audio feature value. Bringing in [p5.js script](https://p5js.org/download/). Exploring [song credits info](https://www.discogs.com/help/creditslist) thanks to [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:database,header:database-artist) and fetching multiple APIs using async and await in JavaScript.
  
_November 8_
  - Ashley: Studying audio features "danceability", "energy", and "valence" from Spotify Web API's [Get Audio Features for a Track](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/). Navigating authorization stuff in Spotify. Looking into "remixing" a project in Glitch that sets up Spotify API requests with NodeJS.
  - Jazmin: Figuring out the direction and speed of a bouncing ball animation in p5.js. A similar exploration was done in Java, but p5.js takes care of things that were previously written from scratch (like the canvas size) and is a web-friendly open source library based on Processing, which is based on Java!
