# An open source project in progress
An open source project collaboration between Ashley Kang (@kangashley) and Jazmin Esqueda (@jazesq), for "Software Development with Open Source Systems"

## Features
- Remember Windows Media Player? How might we make music listening more visual?
- How might we analyze data about sounds to make visible all the people and work behind making sounds?

## Research
- Building a tool

## Requirements

- [ ] Are we using a Linux-based system, a command-line interface, and Computer-Assisted Software Engineering (CASE) tools (ex: version control systems, documentation tools, issue trackers) to manage this project and develop software?
- [ ] Are we communicating effectively?
- [ ] Are we contributing to a code base to (a) solve a problem we've identified, (b) facilitate the performance of a difficult task, _or_ (c) provide functionalities that are missing in other applications?
- [ ] Are we designing code that can adapt to changes in code dependencies?
- [ ] Are we documenting code that the open source community can easily understand and use?
- [ ] Are we using an appropriate [open source license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) based on the libraries we've used and how we want our project to be used?
