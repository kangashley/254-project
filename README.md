# An open source project in progress
An open source project collaboration between Ashley Kang ([@kangashley](https://github.com/kangashley)) and Jazmin Esqueda ([@jazesq](https://github.com/jazesq)), for "Software Development with Open Source Systems"

## Features
- Remember Windows Media Player? How might we make music listening more visual?
- How might we analyze data about sounds to make visible all the people and work behind making sounds?
- How might we connect sounds with visuals?

## Check-ins
_November 15_
  - Ashley: Working over at [Backtrack on Glitch](https://backtrack.glitch.me/). Thinking about how the movement of a visual form can be determined by a range based on an audio feature value. Bringing in [p5.js script](https://p5js.org/download/). Exploring [song credits info](https://www.discogs.com/help/creditslist) thanks to [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:database,header:database-artist) and fetching multiple APIs using async and await in JavaScript.
  
_November 8_
  - Ashley: Studying audio features "danceability", "energy", and "valence" from Spotify Web API's [Get Audio Features for a Track](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/). Navigating authorization stuff in Spotify. Looking into "remixing" a project in Glitch that sets up Spotify API requests with NodeJS.
  - Jazmin: Figuring out the direction and speed of a bouncing ball animation in p5.js. A similar exploration was done in Java, but p5.js takes care of things that were previously written from scratch (like the canvas size) and is a web-friendly open source library based on Processing, which is based on Java!

## Requirements

- [ ] Are we using a Linux-based system, a command-line interface, and Computer-Assisted Software Engineering (CASE) tools (ex: version control systems, documentation tools, issue trackers) to manage this project and develop software?
  - Ashley: MacBook Pro (Mid 2012, 64-bit), Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS
  - Jazmin: MacBook Air (Early 2015, 64-bit), Linux Mint 19 "Tara"
- [ ] Are we communicating effectively?
- [ ] Are we contributing to a code base to (a) solve a problem we've identified, (b) facilitate the performance of a difficult task, _or_ (c) provide functionalities that are missing in other applications?
- [ ] Are we designing code that can adapt to changes in code dependencies?
- [ ] Are we documenting code that the open source community can easily understand and use?
- [ ] Are we using an appropriate [open source license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) based on the libraries we've used and how we want our project to be used?
